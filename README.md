All of these files contain different Kicad keyboard PCBs and Schematics.
None of the files have have a microcontroller in them so they can not simply be downloaded and sent off to get printed, however they are ready for someone to put in and wire up a microcontroller
I am making these files because I could not find any templates online so I just decided to learn how to do it myself and share them with other people.
At some point I'd like to take suggestions and eventually add them to this repsitory.
